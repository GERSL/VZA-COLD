# VZA-COLD: Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) stratified COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD)
VZA-COLD detects nighttime light (NTL) change at 15 arc-second spatial resolution with daily updating capability based on [NASA's Black Marble products](https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

## Code Explanation
We provide the code resources (package name associated with the folder provided in the code) for our publication, which are programmed in MATLAB (2022b) and Python (3.10):
- **VZACOLD**: Nighttime light change detection package (MATLAB)
- **Analysis**: Code for data analysis and visualization (MATLAB + Python (Jupyter Notebook))

## NTL change Product
This product provides nighttime light change information, including change time (Day-of-year and Year), change type (abrupt or gradual), and change intensity, for each year at the VIIRS 15-arc-second pixel level. You can view the dataset through [Google Earth Engine](https://ee-downloading.projects.earthengine.app/view/alan-change)-based application.
